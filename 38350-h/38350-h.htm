<h3><span>TRADITIONS FROM REMOTE PERIODS THROUGH FEW HANDS.</span></h3>

<p>On two or three occasions in the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" instances have been
given of "Traditions from remote periods through few hands," of which it
would not be difficult to adduce numerous additional examples; but my
present purpose is to mention some within my personal experience, or
derived from authentic communication.</p>

<p>In 1781, and my eleventh year, a schoolfellow took me to see his
great-grandmother, a Mrs. Arthur, in Limerick, then aged one hundred and
eight years, whose recollection of that city's siege in 1691, when she
was eighteen, was perfectly fresh and unimpaired, as, indeed, she was
fond of showing by frequent and even unsolicited recurrence to its dread
scenes, in which the women, history tells us, fearlessly participated.
We are here then presented with an interval of one hundred and sixty
years between a memorable event and my recollection of its narrative by
a person actively engaged in it. The old lady's family had furnished a
greater number of chief magistrates to Limerick than any other recorded
in its annals.</p>

<p>Again in 1784, on a visit to my grandfather in the county of Limerick,
during a school vacation, I heard him, then in his eighty-sixth year,
say, that in 1714, on the accession to the British throne of the present
royal dynasty, he heard in Cork, where he was at school, a conversation
between several gentlemen on this change of the reigning family, when
one of them, a Mr. Martin, said that he was born the same day as Charles
II., on the 29th of May, 1631, and was present at the execution of
Charles I., the 29th of January, 1649. His family then resided in
London, where he joined Cromwell's Ironsides, and thence accompanied
them to Ireland. The transfer to him of some forfeited property
naturally induced him to settle there. Thus, between me and the
eye-witness of the regicidal catastrophe, only one person intervenes.</p>

<p>In 1830 there died in London, at the eastern extremity, called the
World's End, an Irishman, aged one hundred and eleven, named Gibson,
whose father, a Scotchman, he told me, served under the Duke of Monmouth
at the battle of Sedgemore in July, 1685, and afterwards, in July, 1690,
under William, at the Boyne. Supposing, as we well may, the father to
have been born about 1660, in 1830, before the son's decease, the two
successive lives thus embrace one hundred and seventy years. I had
rendered the son some services which made him very communicative to me.
The father married and settled in Tipperary, where he became a Roman
Catholic, and no adherent of O'Connell could be more ardent in his cause
than the son. This veteran had served full seventy years in the royal
navy.
<a id="navy114"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>In 1790 I recollect an old man of a hundred and twenty, who appeared
before the French National Assembly, and gave clear answers to questions
on events which he had witnessed one hundred and ten years before.</p>

<p>Similar lengths of personal remembrance are related of old Parr, Lady
Desmond, and others, whose ages exceeded one hundred and forty years.
The daughter-in-law of the French king, Charles IX. (widow of his
natural son, the Duke of Angoulême), survived that monarch by a hundred
and thirty-nine years (1574-1713),&mdash;a rare, if not an unexampled fact.
The famous Cardan, in his singular work, <i>De Vita Propriâ</i>, states that
his grandfather's birth anteceded his own by a hundred and fifty years
(1351-1501). Franklin relates that his grandfather was born in the
sixteenth century, and reign of Elizabeth, as Sir Stephen Fox, the
grandfather of our contemporary statesman, Charles, was born shortly
after the death of James I., in 1627. A very near connexion of my own,
though much younger, is the grandson of a gentleman whose birth
retrocedes to Charles II., in 1672. Niebuhr grounds one of his
objections to the truth of the early Roman history on the very great
improbability of the long period of two hundred and forty-five years
assigned to the collective reigns of the seven kings. It does, indeed,
exceed the average of enthroned life; but the seven monarchs of Spain,
from Ferdinand (the Catholic) to the French Bourbon, Philip V.,
inclusively, embraced a period of two hundred and sixty-seven years in
their successive rule (1469, when Ferdinand obtained the crown of
Arragon, and 1746, the date of Philip's death). The eminent German
historian offers, however, much stronger arguments in disbelief of the
Roman annals; but he had many predecessors in his views, though himself,
unquestionably, the most powerful writer on the subject.</p>

 <p class="right">J. R. (An Octogenarian.)</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;In Vol. iv., p. 73., Madame du Châtelet's epitaph on Voltaire
contains an error, where <i>canis</i> twice appears, but should be <i>carus</i>.
The lady's object was certainly complimentary, not sarcastic. My crampt
writing was of course the cause of the mistake, though, in the <i>opinion
of many</i>, the substituted word would not appear inapplicable to
Voltaire. A subjoined article of the same page, "Children at a Birth,"
reminds me of something analogous in Mercier's <i>Tableau de Paris</i>, where
reference is made to the <i>Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences</i> for the
fact. The wife of a baker, it is there stated, in the short space of
seven years, produced one-and-twenty children, or three at each annual
birth; and, to prove that the prolific faculty was exclusively his, he
made a maid servant similarly the mother of three children at a birth.
The major portion, it appears, of this numerous progeny long survived.
Bayle, in his article of Tiraqueau, a French advocate of the sixteenth
century, quotes an epigram, which would make him the father of
forty-five children, and, it is added, by one wife. If so, several must
at least have been twins:</p>

     <div class="poem">
 <p>"Fæcundus facundus aquæ Tiraquellus amator,</p>
      <p>Terquindecim librorum et liberum parens;</p>
      <p>Qui nisi restinxisset aquis abstemius ignes,</p>
      <p>Implesset orbem prole animi atque corporis."</p>
</div>

<p>The accomplished authoress of <i>A Residence on the Shores of the Baltic</i>
(1841, 2 volumes) was, it is well known, one of <i>four</i> congenital
children in Norwich, where her father was an eminent physician.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>Nelson's Coat</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 517.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The recognition of the coat
Nelson wore at Trafalgar depends on its fulfilling a detail in the
following fact. The present Captain Sir George Westphal was a midshipman
on board the Victory, and was wounded on the back of the head: he was
taken into the cockpit, and placed by the side of Nelson. When
Westphal's wound was dressed, nothing else being immediately available,
Nelson's coat was rolled up and used as a support to Westphal's head.
Blood flowed from the wound, and, coagulating, stuck the bullion of one
of the epaulettes to the bandage; it was deemed better to cut off some
of the bullion curls to liberate the coat: so that the coat Nelson wore
on that day will be found minus of bullion in one of the epaulettes.</p>

<h4><span><i>Strange Reasons for keeping a Public-house.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A clergyman in the
south-west of England, calling lately on one of his parishioners, who
kept a public-house, remarked to her how sorry he was, when passing
along the road, to hear such noises proceeding from her house. "I
wonder," said he, "that any woman can keep a public-house, especially
one where there is so much drunkenness and depravity as in yours." "Oh,
Sir," she replied, "that is the very reason why I like to keep such a
house, because I see every day so much of the <i>worst part of human
nature</i>."</p>

     <p class="right">T. W.</p>


<h4><span><i>Superstitions with regard to Glastonbury Thorn.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;It is handed down,
that when Joseph of Arimathea, during his mission to England, arrived at
Weary-all-hill, near Glastonbury, he struck his travelling staff into
the earth, which immediately took root, and ever after put forth its
leaves and blossoms on Christmas Day, being converted into a miraculous
thorn.</p>

<p>This tree, which had two trunks, was preserved until the time of Queen
Elizabeth; when one of the trunks was destroyed by a Puritan, and
the
<a id="the115"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[115]</span>
 other met with the same fate during the Great Rebellion.</p>

<p>Throughout the reign of Henry VIII., its blossoms were esteemed such
great curiosities, and sovereign specifics, as to become an object of
gain to the merchants of Bristol; who not only disposed of them to the
inhabitants of their own city, but <i>exported</i> these blossoms to
different parts of Europe. There were, in addition to these, relics for
rain, for avoiding the evil eye, for rooting out charlock, and all weeds
in corn, with similar specifics, which were considered, at this time,
<i>the best of all property</i>!</p>

 <p class="right"> T. W.</p>


<h4><span><i>The miraculous Walnut-tree at Glastonbury.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;This far-famed tree was at
the north of St. Joseph's chapel, in the abbey churchyard. It was
supposed to have been brought from Palestine by some of the pilgrims,
and was visited in former days, and regarded as sacred by <i>all ranks</i> of
people; and, even so late as the time of King James, that monarch, as
well as his ministers and nobility, paid large sums for sprigs of it,
which were preserved as holy relics.</p>

 <p class="right">T. W.</p>


<h4><span><i>The Three Estates of the Realm.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Some, even educated persons of this
day, if asked which are the three estates of the realm, will reply, the
Queen, Lords, and Commons. That the three estates do not include the
Queen, and are therefore the Lords, the Clergy in Convocation, and the
Commons, is obvious from the title of the "Form of Prayer with
Thanksgiving to be used yearly upon the 5th day of November, for the
happy Deliverance of <i>King James I.</i> and the Three Estates of England
from the most Traitorous," &amp;c.; and also from the following passage of
the Communion Collect for Gunpowder Treason:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Eternal God, and our most mighty Protector, we Thy unworthy
   servants do humbly present ourselves before Thy Majesty,
   acknowledging Thy power, wisdom, and goodness, in preserving <i>the
   king</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">AND</span> <i>the three estates</i> of the realm of England assembled
   in Parliament, from the destruction this day intended against
   them."</p>

<h2><span class="bla">Queries.</span></h2>

<h3><span>BENSLEYS OF NORWICH.</span></h3>

<p>As I am much interested in the above family, which I know to have
existed at Norwich, or the vicinity, for a century or more, and have
reason to think was one of some consequence, will you, through the
medium of your useful columns, allow me to ask some of your intelligent
correspondents who reside in that neighbourhood the following Queries?</p>

<p>1. Is anything known of the family of the late Sir William Bensley
farther back than his father, Thomas Bensley? Sir William was born in
the county of Norfolk, and at an early age entered the navy; transferred
himself to the Honourable East India Company's service, made a large
fortune, was elected a Director of the Company 1771, created a baronet
1801, and died without issue 1809.</p>

<p>2. Was Mr. Richard Bensley, an actor of some celebrity, who made his
"first appearance" in 1765 (he had previously been an officer in the
Marines, and, as I am informed, held the appointment of barrack-master
at Knightsbridge till his death in 1817), any connexion of the above, or
at all connected with Norwich?</p>

<p>3. Cowper, in one of his letters [to Joseph Hill, Esq., dated
Huntingdon, July 3, 1765], says:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"The tragedies of Lloyd and Bensley are both very deep. If they
   are of no use to the surviving part of society, it is their own
   fault," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Any information as to who this Bensley was, will be very acceptable; or
anything concerning the tragedies mentioned.</p>

<p>4. Any intelligence respecting one "Isaac Bensley" of Norwich, weaver;
who was alive in 1723, as his son was in that year baptized at the
Octagon Chapel in that city.</p>

<p>If any of your contributors, in their archæological researches among

<h4><span>68. <i>Heraldic Figures at Tonbridge Castle.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the court of the castle
of this place, there stands a colossal figure of what I take to be an
heraldic panther gorged with a ducal crown, supporting a shield of the
royal arms of France and England quarterly, as borne before the
accession of James I.</p>

<p>The corresponding supporter is gone, but the base and one claw remain,
showing it to have been a beast of prey, and with it is a broken shield,
thereon, "party per pale three lions rampant;" the arms, and probably
the supporter of the Herberts, earls of Pembroke. The two figures have
evidently capped the piers of a gateway.</p>

<p>Can any of your readers account for the presence of these figures here,
where the Herberts are not recorded to have possessed any property?</p>

<h4><span>72. <i>Cervantes&mdash;what was the Date of his Death?</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the Life prefixed
to a corrected edition of Jarvis's translation, published by Miller,
1801, it is stated to be April 23, 1616; and it is added:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "It is a singular coincidence of circumstances, that the same day
   should deprive the world of two men of such transcendent
   abilities as Cervantes and Shakspeare, the latter of whom died in
   England on the very day that put an end to the life of the former
   in Spain."</p>

<p>Dr. Christopher Wordsworth, in his Life of his uncle, the poet, remarks
on his decease on the anniversary of the death of Shakspeare, but makes
no allusion to the double anniversary; and in the Life of Cervantes
prefixed to Smollet's translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, the day of
Cervantes' death is somewhat differently stated.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "At Dewsbury, Yorkshire, there is a bell called 'Black Tom of

   Christmas-eve as at a funeral, or in the manner of a
   passing-bell: and any one asking whose bell it was, would be told
   that it was the <i>devil's knell</i>. The moral of it is, that the
   devil died when Christ was born. The custom was discontinued for
   many years, but was revived by the vicar in 1828."</p>

<p>Is the gift of a bell a common expiatory gift for crime? And does the

other place at the present time?</p>

<h4><span>77. <i>Queries on Poems of Richard Rolle</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 49.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I should be
glad to ask a question or two of your Cambridge correspondent, touching
his very interesting contribution from the MS. remains of Richard Rolle
of Hampole.</p>

<p>What language is meant by the <i>deuenisch</i>?</p>

<p>What is a <i>guystroun</i>?</p>

<p>How does the word <i>chaunsemlees</i> come to mean shoes?</p>

<p>An expression very strange to English verse occurs in the line,</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"Hir cher was ay <i>semand</i> sori."</p>
</div>

<p>I can think of nothing to throw light upon this intensive adverb, except
the Danish <i>saamænd</i>, which is generally used in that language (or
rather
<a id="rather117"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[117]</span>
 <i>was</i> used, i.e. when Holberg wrote his comedies) as an
affirmatory oath. Native authorities explain it to mean "<i>so</i> it is, by
the holy <i>men</i>," or in other terms, "by the saints I swear."</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the same kindness which led your correspondent to
communicate those delightful extracts, will also make him willing to
assist the understanding of them.</p>

<h4><span>78. <i>Did Bishop Gibson write a Life of Cromwell?</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Carlyle, in
treating on the biographies of Oliver Cromwell, says that the <i>Short
Critical Review of the Life of Oliver Cromwell</i>, by a gentleman of the
Middle Temple, was written by a certain "Mr. Banks, a kind of a lawyer
and playwright," and that the anonymous <i>Life of Oliver Cromwell, Lord
Protector of the Commonwealth, impartially collected, &amp;c.</i>, London,
1724, which Noble ascribes to Bishop Gibson, was by "one Kember, a
dissenting minister of London."</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Russell, in his <i>Life of Oliver Cromwell</i>, 2
vols. 12mo. 1829, says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "There is an anonymous work deserving of some notice, entitled <i>A
   Short Critical Review of the Political Life of Oliver Cromwell</i>.
   The title professes that it was written by a gentleman of the
   Middle Temple, but there is reason to believe that it proceeded
   from the pen of the learned Bishop Gibson."</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, by these statements, that two different lives
of the Great Protector have been ascribed to Gibson. Query, Did Gibson
ever write a life of Cromwell; and if so, which is it?</p>

<p>It is well worth knowing which Gibson did write, if he wrote one at all,
for he was connected with the Cromwell family, and, what is of more
consequence, a learned, liberal man, not given to lying, so that his
book probably contains more truth than any of the other Cromwell
biographies of that time.</p>

<h4><span>79. <i>English Translation of Alcon.</i></span></h4>

paraphrase of it. The parallel passages are to be found in (I think) No.
47. of the <i>Classical Journal</i>, published formerly by Valpy. The
prototypes of L'Allegro and Il Penseroso are at the beginning of
Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>. Thus three of Milton's early poems
cannot be termed wholly original.</p>

<h3><span>JOHN BODLEY.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 59.)</span></h3>

<p>John Bodley is a name that ought not to be passed over without due
reverence. He not only fostered the translation of the Genevan Bible,
but was specially interested in its circulation throughout England.
Neither Fox, Burnet, or Strype, Mr. Todd, or Mr. Whittaker give us any
particular information respecting him. Lewis glances at him as <i>one</i>
John Bodley; and Mr. Townley, in his valuable <i>Biblical Literature</i>,
after some notice of Whittingham, Gilby, Sampson, &amp;c., closes by saying,
"Of John Bodleigh no account has been obtained."</p>

<p>This good and pious man was the father of the celebrated Sir Thomas
Bodley. He was born at Exeter, and according to the statement of his son
(<i>Autobiography</i>, 4to., Oxf. 1647),&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"In the time of Queen Mary, after being cruelly threatened and
   narrowly observed by those that maliced his religion, for the
   safety of himself and my mother (formerly Miss Joan Hone, an
   heiress in the hundred of Ottery St. Mary), who was wholly
   affected as my father, knew no way so secure as to fly into
   Germany; where, after a while, he found means to call over my
   mother, with all his children and family, when he settled for a
   while at Wesel, in Cleveland, and from thence we removed to the
   town of Frankfort. Howbeit, we made no long tarriance in either
   of these towns, for that my father had resolved to fix his abode
   in the city of Geneva, where, as far as I remember, the English
   Church consisted of some hundred members."</p>

<p>John Bodley returned to England in 1559, and on the 8th of January,
1560-61, a patent was granted to him by Queen Elizabeth, "to imprint, or
cause to be imprinted, the English Bible, with annotations." This
privilege was to last for the space of seven years. In 1565 Bodley was
preparing for a new impression; and by March the next year, a careful
review and correction being finished, this zealous reformer wished to
<i>renew</i> his patent beyond the seven years first granted. It does not
appear, however, that his application to the authorities had the desired
effect; for it will be remembered that Archbishop Parker's Bible was now
in the field, and the Queen's Secretary, Sir William Cecil, was
compelled to act with caution. A curious letter, addressed by the
Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London to Sir William Cecil,
concerning the extension of Bodley's privilege, is printed from the
Lansdown MS. No. 8. (Art. 82.), in <i>Letters of Eminent Literary Men</i>,
edited by Sir Henry Ellis for the Camden Society.</p>

<p>For a full history of the Geneva Bible, I beg to refer S. S. S. to the
second volume of Anderson's <i>Annals of the English Bible:</i> Lond. 2 vols.
8vo. 1845.</p>

     <p class="right"> E<span class="smcap lowercase">DWARD</span> F. R<span class="smcap lowercase">IMBAULT</span>.</p>

<p>In the notice of Sir Thomas Bodley contained in Prince's <i>Worthies of
Devon</i>, S. S. S. will find some particulars relating to his father, John
Bodley. Prince's account of Sir Thomas is "from a MS. on probable
grounds supposed to be his own handwriting, now in the custody of a
neighbour gentleman," (Walter Bogan of Gatcombe, near
<a id="near118"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[118]</span>
Totnes.)
From this it appears that John Bodley was long resident at Geneva&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Where [says Sir Thomas], as far as I remember, the English
   church consisted of some hundred persons. I was at that time of
   twelve years of age, but through my father's cost and care
   sufficiently instructed to become an auditor of Chevalerius in
   Hebrew, of Beraldus in Greek, of Calvin and Beza in divinity, and
   of some other professors in the university, which was then newly
   erected: besides my domestical teachers in the house of
   Philibertus Saracenus, a famous physician in that city, with whom
   I was boarded, where Robertus Constantinus, that made the Greek
   Lexicon, read Homer unto me."</p>

<p>There is, however, no mention of John Bodley's having been one of the
translators of the Bible.</p>

<h3><span>WITHER'S "HALLELUJAH."<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 330.)</span></h3>

<p>A correspondent, S. S. S., inquires concerning one of the numberless,
and now almost fameless, works of George Wither, a poet of the
seventeenth century, famous in his generation, but unworthily disparaged
in that which followed him; the names of Quarles and Wither being
proverbially classed with those of Bavius and Mævius in the Augustan
age. The <i>Hallelujah</i> of the latter has become precious from its rarity.
A copy of this volume (of nearly 500 pages) was lent to me several years
ago, by a collector of such treasures. On the blank at the back of the
cover, there was written a memorandum that it had been bought at Heber's
sale by Thorpe the bookseller for sixteen guineas; my friend, I had
reason to believe, paid a much higher price for it, when it fell into
his hands. The contents consist of several hundreds of <i>hymns</i> for all
sorts and conditions of men, on all the ordinary, and on many of the
extraordinary circumstances of human life. Of course they are very
heterogeneous, yet no small number are beyond the average of such
compositions in point of devotional and poetical excellence.</p>

<p>The author himself, with the consciousness of Horace, in his</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"Exegi monumentum ære perennius,"</p>
</div>

<p>crowns his labours at the 487th page with the following "Io triumphe"
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Although my Muse flies yet far short of those,</p>
     <p> Who perfect Hallelujahs can compose,</p>
      <p>Here to affirm I am not now afraid,</p>
      <p>What once in part a heathen prophet said,</p>
     <p> With slighter warrant, when to end was brought</p>
      <p>What he for meaner purposes had wrought;</p>
     <p> <i>The work is finished</i>, which nor human power,</p>
      <p>Nor flames, nor times, nor envy shall devour,</p>
      <p>But with devotion to God's praise be sung</p>
      <p>As long as Britain speaks her English tongue,</p>
     <p> Or shall that Christian saving faith possess,</p>
     <p> Which will preserve these Isles in happiness;</p>
     <p> And, if conjecture fail not, some, that speak</p>
     <p> In other languages, shall notice take</p>
      <p>Of what my humble musings have composed,</p>
     <p> And, by these helps, be often more disposed</p>
     <p> To celebrate His praises in their songs,</p>
      <p>To whom all honour and all praise belongs."</p>
</div>

<p>How has this fond anticipation been fulfilled? There are not known (says
my authority) to be more than <i>three</i> or <i>four</i> copies in existence of
this indestructible work; and the price in gold which a solitary
specimen can command, is no evidence of anything but its market value.
Had its poetic worth been proportionate, its currency might have been as
common as that of Milton's masterpiece, and its trade price as low as
Paternoster Row could afford a cheap edition of the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i>.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Few books of a cotemporary date can more readily be procured
   than Wither's first <i>Remembrancer</i> in 1628; few, it is believed,
   can be more difficult of attainment than his second
   <i>Remembrancer</i>, licensed in 1640, of which latter Dalrymple
   observes, 'there are some things interspersed in it, nowhere,
   perhaps, to be surpassed.'"&mdash;<i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>, p. 1971.</p>



<h3><span>FIRST PANORAMA.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 54.)</span></h3>

<p>I did not speak of my own recollection of Girtin's panorama; my memory
cannot reach so far back. It was my father who does perfectly remember
<i>Girtin's</i> semicircular panorama. I think the mistake must be with H. T.
E. Some years back a large collection of Girtin's drawings and sketches
were sold at Pimlico; my father went to see them, and was delighted to
find among them some of the original sketches for this panorama, which
he immediately recognised and bought. He afterwards showed them to
Girtin's son, now living in practice as a surgeon at Islington (I
believe), who identified them as his father's work, and with whom I went
to see the painting, when not many years back it was found in a
carpenter's loft. Girtin certainly was a painter principally in water
colour, and one who, with the present J. M. W. Turner, contributed much
to the advancement of that branch of art; but I do not see how that is a
reason why he did not paint a panorama. I should think it not unlikely
that two semicircular panoramas of the same subject were painted; and,
therefore, with all deference, believe that the mistake is with H. T. E.
Girtin's son, if applied to, could, and I am sure would, give any
information he possessed readily.</p>

      <p class="right">E. N. W.
<a id="readily119"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>We are not yet quite right about the first panorama, but perhaps the
following will close the discussion.</p>

<p>I have lately been sitting with Mr. Barker (ætat 78), and he tells me
that, when quite a boy, he sketched for his father the view of Edinburgh
from the observatory on the Calton Hill: in the foreground was Holyrood
House; that <i>that</i> was a half circle, and was exhibited in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>So much was thought of the discovery of its being <i>possible</i> to take a
view beyond the old rule of sixty degrees, that they went to London, and
then he took the view from the top of the Albion Mills, as was stated in
Vol. iv., p. 54.</p>

<p>That was three quarters of a circle, and was exhibited in Castle Street,
Leicester Square. Afterwards the whole circle was attempted. The idea of
painting a view more than sixty degrees, was suggested by his mother.
His father did not work at them, he being a portrait painter; but <i>he</i>
did, young as he was. Mr. Robert Barker and his wife were both Irish;
but Henry Aston the son was born in Glasgow.</p>

<h3><span>JOHN A KENT.<br />

uncertainty whether or not they may prove acceptable to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sion y Cent</i>, i.e. John a Kent, or John of Kentchurch, is very

few&mdash;unable to account for the mysterious disappearance of the hero&mdash;are
still firmly convinced that he sleeps, like Montezuma and various other
mighty men, in some deep cavern, surrounded by his warriors, until the
wrongs of his country shall call him forth once more to lead them on to
battle.</p>

<p>The following extracts are from notes appended [by the editors] to some
poems of John a Kent which are published amongst the "Iolo MSS." by the
"Welsh MSS. Society."</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "... John of Kent, as he is called, is said to have been a priest
   at Kentchurch in Herefordshire, on the confines of Wales, about
   the beginning of the fifteenth century. He still enjoys a high
   degree of popularity, in the legendary stories of the
   principality, as a powerful magician. There is in the possession
   of Mr. Scudamore, of Kentchurch, an ancient painting of a monk,
   supposed to be a portrait of John of Kent; and as the family of
   Scudamore is descended from a daughter of Owen Glendowr, at whose
   house that chieftain is believed to have passed in concealment a
   portion of the latter part of his life, it has been supposed that
   John of Kentchurch was no other than Owen Glendowr himself," &amp;c.
   &amp;c.&mdash;Page 676., note to the poem on <i>The Names of God</i>.</p>

  <p> "... The author was a priest of Kentchurch in Herefordshire, on
   the confines of Monmouthshire and Breconshire, and is said to
   have lived in the time of Wickliffe, and to have been of his
   party. As the parish of Kentchurch is adjacent to that of
   Oldcastle, the residence of Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, it
   is by no means impossible that John of Kentchurch may also have
   favoured the same opinions; and may in some measure sanction the
   idea."</p>

   <p>"... The poet then proceeds to speak of the indignation of the
   well-robed bishops, the monks, friars and priests; and in the
   course of the composition he makes some strong animadversions on
   the luxurious living of the churchmen, stating that formerly the
   friars were preachers, who possessed no wealth, and went about on
   foot with nothing but a staff; but that they now possessed
   horses, and frequented banquets," &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Page 687., notes to <i>A
   Poem to another's Book</i>, by John of Kentchurch; from the
   collection of Thomas ap Jevan of Tre'r Bryn, made about 1670.</p>

<p>The following words occur in this poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>  "... onid côf cwymp</p>
      <p>Olcastr, ti a gair ailcwymp."</p>

      <p>"&mdash;&mdash; rememberest thou not the fall</p>
      <p>Of Oldcastle?&mdash;Thou shall have a repetition of the fall."</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the two poems here mentioned, the collection contains one
"<i>Composed by John of Kent on his death-bed</i>;" in which are some lines
of considerable beauty: and also one on <i>The Age and Duration of
Things</i>.</p>

<p>The parish church of Kentchurch is dedicated to St. Mary. I hope to be
able to send you some further information on the subject, but I well
know that quotations from memory are <i>nearly</i> valueless. Meanwhile, the
following note on the mysterious disappearance to which I have already
alluded may be not uninteresting: I give it as translated by the editors
of the Iolo MSS.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"In 1415, Owen disappeared, so that neither sight nor tidings of
   him could be obtained in the country. It was rumoured that he
   escaped in the guise of a reaper; bearing<a id="bearing1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ... according to the
   testimony of the last who saw and knew him; after which little or
   no information transpired respecting him, nor of the place or
   manner of his concealment. The prevalent opinion was, that he
   died in a wood in Glamorgan; but occult chroniclers assert that
   he and his men still live, and are asleep on their arms, in a
   cave called Govog y ddinas, in the Vale of Gwent, where they will
   continue, until England becomes self-debased; but that then they
   will sally forth, and reconquer their country, privileges, and
   crown for the Welsh, who shall be dispossessed of them no more
   until the day of judgment, when the world shall be consumed with
   fire, and so reconstructed, that neither oppression nor
   devastation shall take place any more: and blessed will be he who
   shall see the time."&mdash;Page 454.

<p>Llywelyn, as has been shown, had two sons, Griffith and David, the first
and eldest of whom, being a turbulent prince, was set aside by his
father at a solemn assembly of Cambrian lords, in 1238, and David was
elected to succeed his father. In 1240, David became king of North
Wales, and one of his first acts was to apprehend his brother and his
son Owen, and put them in prison. This was done with the connivance of a
Bishop of Bangor: but that worthy, fearing that the scandal would spread
abroad, intrigued with <i>Senena</i>, the <i>daughter-in-law</i>, and not the
daughter of Prince Llywelyn, and wife of his son Griffith, for his
release. Overtures were made to Henry III.; and certain lords having
joined the confederacy, stipulations were entered into, and Henry
marched against King David. David, who had married the king's daughter,
now began to counterplot, in which he was quite successful; for Henry,
who had come to release Griffith, by <i>special contract</i> with his
brother, took him, with his wife Senena, and his son Owen, with him to
London, and imprisoned them in the Tower, in attempting to escape from
whence, two years afterwards, Griffith lost his life. Such is a brief
outline of all that is known of Senena, who is undoubtedly the Sidanen
of Munday, and whose name is variously written <i>Sina</i>, <i>Sanan</i>,
<i>Sanant</i>, and in the Latin chronicle <i>Senena</i>. The negotiations here
alluded to, with the names of all the parties engaged in them, will be
found in the authorities herein named; all of which being in English,
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span> can easily consult.</p>

<p>John a Cumber is probably John y Kymro, or John the Cambrian; but I know
nothing of him.</p>

<p>Respecting John of Kent there is but little else known than may be found
in Coxe's <i>Monmouthshire</i>, and Owen's <i>Cambrian Biography</i>, sub "Sion
Cent." There is, however, a tradition in this neighbourhood that he was
born at Eglwys Ilan, in the county of Glamorgan; and the road is shown
by which he went to Kentchurch, in Herefordshire. It was at Eglwys Ilan
that he is reported to have pounded the crows by closing the park gates.
As this story has not appeared in English print, I will endeavour to
furnish you again with a more circumstantial statement. Sion Kent, who
lived about 1450, appears to have derived his name from Kent Chester, or
Kent Church. He was a monk, holding Lollard opinions; and a bard of
considerable talent and celebrity. As a matter of course, he was on good
terms with his Satanic majesty; for he was a mighty reputation as a
conjuror. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span> may find a portion of one of his poems, translated
in the Iolo MSS., page 687. Should this, or any other authority herein
named, not be accessible to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span>, it would afford me great
pleasure to send him transcripts.</p>

<p>There is a very gross anachronism in making Sion, <i>lege</i> Shôn Kent, to
be the contemporary of Senena.</p>

<h3><span>PETTY CURY.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 24.)</span></h3>

<p>I believe that Petty Cury signifies the Little Cookery. See a note in my
<i>Annals of Cambridge</i>, vol. i. p. 273.</p>

     <p class="right">C. H. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OOPER</span>.</p>
     <p class="left">Cambridge, July 12. 1851.</p>

<p>To those who are familiar with the <i>Form of Cury</i>, edited by Dr. Pegge,
no explanation can be necessary for the name of this street, or rather
lane. It seems, indeed, strange that any one who calls himself a
Cambridge man should have failed to discover that it was the peculiar
quarter of the <i>cooks</i> of the town; as we in London have our Poultry
named from the <i>Poulters</i> (not <i>Poulterers</i>, as now corruptly
designated) who there had their shops.</p>

      <p class="right">F. S. Q.</p>

<p>The Cambridge senate-house is called "Curia,"
<a id="Curia121"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[121]</span>
 and therefore it
may be supposed that "Petty Cury" means "<i>parva curia</i>," from some
court-leet or court-baron formerly held there; the town-hall is at the
end of it to this day. The only objection to the above is, that in the
Caius map of Cambridge, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1574, now in the British Museum, Petty
Curie is a large street even then, whilst neither town-hall nor
senate-house exist.</p>

    <p class="right">J. E<span class="smcap lowercase">ASTWOOD</span>.</p>

<p>Surely there can be little doubt that the name of this street at
Cambridge is a corruption from the French "petite écurie." We knew
little enough about such matters when I was an undergraduate there; but
still, I think, we could have solved this mystery. Might I be permitted
to suggest that as the court stables at Versailles were called "les
petites écuries," to distinguish them from the king's, which were styled
"les grandes écuries," although they exactly resembled them, and
contained accommodation for five hundred horses; so the street in
question may have contained some of the fellows' stables, which were
called "les petites écuries," to distinguish them from the masters'.
Should this supposition be correct, it would seem to imply that at one
time the French language was not altogether <i>ignored</i> at Cambridge.</p>

<h3><span>THE WORD "RACK" IN THE "TEMPEST."&mdash;THE NEBULAR THEORY.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 218.; Vol. iv., p. 37.)</span></h3>


<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON</span> seems to court opinion as to the justness of his
interpretation of <i>rack</i>. I therefore express my total and almost
indignant dissent from it.</p>

<p>Luckily, neither in the proposition itself, nor in the manner in which
it is advocated, is there anything to disturb my previous conviction as
to the true meaning of this word (which, in the well-known passage in
the <i>Tempest</i>, is, beyond all doubt, "haze" or "vapour"), since few
things would be more distasteful to me than to encounter any argument
really capable of throwing doubt upon the reading of a passage I have
long looked upon as one of the most marvellous instances of
philosophical depth of thought to be met with, even in Shakspeare,&mdash;one
of those astonishing speculations, in advance of his age, that now and
then drop from him as from the lips of a child inspired,&mdash;wherein the
grandeur of the sentiment is so out of all proportion to the simplicity
and absence of pretension with which it is introduced, that the reader,
not less surprised than delighted, is scarcely able to appreciate the
full meaning until after long and careful consideration.</p>

<p>It is only lately that the nebular theory of condensation has been
advanced, for the purpose of speculating upon the probable formation of
planetary bodies. Yet it is a subject that possesses a strange
coincidence with this passage of Shakspeare's <i>Tempest</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best elucidation I can give of it will be to cite a certain
passage in Dr. Nichols' <i>Architecture of the Heavens</i>, which happens to
bear a rather remarkable, although I believe an accidental, resemblance
to Shakspeare's words: <i>accidental</i>, because if Dr. Nichols had this
passage of the <i>Tempest</i> present to his mind, when writing in a
professedly popular and familiar style, he would scarcely have omitted
allusion to it, especially as it would have afforded a peculiarly happy
illustration of his subject.</p>

<p>I shall now quote both passages, in order that they may be conveniently
compared:</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p> "Our revels now are ended&mdash;these our actors</p>
      <p>As I foretold you, were all spirits, and</p>
      <p>Are melted into air&mdash;INTO THIN AIR:</p>
     <p> And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,</p>
      <p>The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,</p>
     <p> The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</p>
      <p>Yea, all that it inherit&mdash;shall dissolve&mdash;</p>
     <p> And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,</p>
      <p>Leave not a rack behind."</p>
</div>

   <p class="blockquot">"&mdash;&mdash; in the laboratory of the chemist matter easily passes
   through all conditions, the solid, liquid, and gaseous, as if <i>in
   a sort of phantasmagoria</i>; and his highest discoveries even now
   are pointing to the conclusion, that the bodies which make up the
   solid portion of our earth may, simply by the dissolution of
   existing combinations, <i>be ultimately resolved into a permanently
   gaseous form</i>."&mdash;Nichols' <i>Architecture of the Heavens</i>, p. 147.</p>

<p>Had we no other presumption to lead us to Shakspeare's true meaning but
what is afforded by the expression, "into air&mdash;thin air," it ought, in
my opinion, to be amply sufficient; for no rational person can entertain
a doubt that Shakspeare intended the repetition, "thin air," to have
reference to the simile that was to follow. The globe itself shall
dissolve, and, like this vision, leave not a <i>rack</i> behind! In what was
the resemblance to the vision to consist, if not in melting, like it,
into <i>thin</i> air? into air unobscured by vapour, rarified from the
slightest admixture of rack or cloud.</p>

<p>Shakespeare knew that atmospheric rack is not insubstantial; that it is
corporeal like the globe itself, of which it is a part; and that, so
long as a particle of it remained, dissolution could not be complete.</p>

<p>And shall we reject this exquisite philosophy&mdash;this profundity of
thought&mdash;to substitute our own mean and common-place ideas?</p>

     <p class="right">A. E. B.</p>
 <p class="left"> Leeds, July 22.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Apart from the philosophical beauty of this wonderful passage,
there are other aspects in which it may be studied with not less
interest.</p>

<p>How true is the poetical image of the <i>rack</i> as
<a id="rack122"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[122]</span>
 the last object
of dissipation! the expiring evidence of combustion! the lingering
cloudiness of solution!</p>

Cromwell, which, I fearlessly assert, I have seen frequently in print,
but cannot at present tell where; and more important avocations forbid
me to search. As if that was not enough, in Vol. iv., p. 50. there is
another half page respecting the preservation of these <i>precious MSS.</i>!

<h4><span><i>Margaret Maultasch</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 56.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent who
inquires where he can meet with the particulars of the life of Margaret,
surnamed <i>Maultasch</i>, Countess of Tyrol, will find them in the
Supplement of the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, vol. lxxiii. p. 136.</p>

<p>The great heiress in question, though a monster of ugliness, was twice
married: first to John Henry, son of Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia (1331),
from whom she procured a divorce on the plea of his incapacity; and,
secondly (1341), to Louis of Bavaria, eldest son of the Emperor Louis
IV., by whom she had a son, Mainard, who died without issue during his
mother's lifetime.</p>

<p>I know not upon what authority rest the imputed irregularities of her
life, but her biographer, in the article above mentioned, casts no such
slur upon her character. Nor can I discover that the armorial bearings
of the town of Halle, in Tyrol, have any such significant meaning as has
been hinted at. They are to be found in Matthew Merian's <i>Topographia
Provinciarum Austriacarum</i>, printed at Frankfort on the Maine in 1649,
engraved on the view of Halle, at p. 139., and appear to be <i>a cask or
barrel, supported by two lions</i>. There is <i>no</i> statue of Margaret
Maultasch among those which surround the mausoleum of Emperor
<i>Maximilian</i> (not <i>Matthias</i>) in the Franciscan church at Inspruck; but
her ludicrously hideous features may be found amongst the historical
portraits engraved in the magnificent work descriptive of the Museum of
Versailles, published a few years ago at Paris, under the auspices of
King Louis Philippe.</p>

<h4><span><i>Pope's Translations or Imitations of Horace</i></span>
<span>(Vol. i., p. 230.; Vol. iv., p. 58.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Is your correspondent C. correct in attributing <i>A true
Character of Mr. Pope and his Writings, in a Letter to a Friend</i>,
printed for Popping, 1716, to Oldmixon? In the Testimonies of Authors,
prefixed to the <i>Dunciad</i>, and the Appendix, and throughout the Notes,
Dennis is uniformly quoted and attacked as the author. Oldmixon's feud
with Pope was hardly, I think, so early.</p>

<p>Assuming your correspondent's quotation from the pamphlet to be correct,
the terms made use of will surely refer to Pope's <i>Imitation of Horace</i>
(S. ii. L. i.), a fragment of which was published by Curll about this
time (1716). It was afterwards republished in folio about 1734, printed
for J. Boreman, under the title of <i>Sober Advice from Horace to the
young Gentlemen about Town</i>, but in an enlarged state, and with some of
the initials altered, and several new adaptations. Mrs. Oldfield and
Lady Mary are not introduced in the first edition. I have both, but at
present can only refer to the second one in folio. From this the
<i>Imitation</i> was transferred to the Supplement to
<a id="to123"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[123]</span>
 Pope's Works,
published by Cooper: London, 1757, 12mo., and from thence to the
Supplementary Volumes to the later editions. The publication of it
formed an article of impeachment against Dr. Jos. Warton, by the author
of the <i>Pursuits of Literature</i>, as all who have read that satire will
well remember.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"When General Washington, after being appointed commander of the
   army of the revolutionary war, came to Massachusetts to organize
   it, and make preparations for the defence of the country, he
   found a great want of ammunition and other means necessary to
   meet the powerful foe he had to contend with, and great
   difficulty to obtain them. If attacked in such condition, the
   cause at once might be hopeless. On one occasion at that anxious
   period a consultation of the officers and others was had, when it
   seemed no way could be devised to make such preparations as were
   necessary. His Excellency Jonathan Trumbull the elder was then
   governor of the State of Connecticut, on whose judgment and aid
   the general placed the greatest reliance, and remarked, 'We must
   consult Brother Jonathan on the subject.' The general did so, and
   the governor was successful in supplying many of the wants of the
   army. When difficulties afterwards arose, and the army was spread
   over the country, it became a by-word, 'We <i>must consult</i> Brother
   Jonathan.' The term Yankee is still applied to a portion, but
   'Brother Jonathan' has now become a designation of the whole
   country, as John Bull has for England."&mdash;<i>Dictionary of
   Americanisms</i>, by John Russell Bartlett, 1849.</p>

<h4><span><i>Cromwell's Grants of Land in Monaghan</i></span>
 <span>(Vol. iv., p. 87.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;E. A. asks
whether there are any grants of land in the county of Monaghan recorded
as made by Cromwell, and where such records are preserved? I fear I can
give but a negative answer to the question: but among the stores of the
State Paper Office are many books of orders, letters, &amp;c. during the
Commonwealth. Among them are two bundles dated in 1653, which relate to
the lands granted by lot, to the adventurers who had advanced money for
the army, in the different provinces of Ireland. Monaghan is not
mentioned.</p>

<h4><span><i>Stanedge Pole</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 391.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In answer to your correspondent
A. N., I beg to state that Stanedge Pole is between six and seven miles
from Sheffield, on the boundary line between Yorkshire and Derbyshire,
on a long causeway which was in former times the road from Yorkshire to
Manchester. Its only antiquity consists in having been for centuries one
of the meers marking the boundaries of Hallamshire. In Harrison's
<i>Survey of the Manor of Sheffield</i>, 1637, appears an account of the
boundaries as viewed and seen the 6th of August, 1574, from which the
following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Item. From the said Hurkling Edge so forward after the Rock to
   Stannedge, which is a meer between the said Lordshipps (of
   Hallamshire and Hathersedge).</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Item. From Stannedge after the same rock to a place called the
   Broad Rake, which is also a meer between the said Lordshipps of
   Hallamshire and Hathersedge."</p>

<p>The situation is a very fine one, commanding a very beautiful and
extensive view of the surrounding country.<a id="country3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> </p>

<h4><span><i>Baskerville the Printer</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 40.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Baskerville was interred
in the grounds attached to the house in which he lived, near Easy Row,
Birmingham. The land becoming valuable for building purposes, he was,
after lying there about half a century, disinterred and removed to the
workshop of a lead merchant, named Marston, in Monmouth Street,
Birmingham. While there I saw his remains. They were in a wooden coffin,
which was enclosed in one of lead. How long they had been above ground I
do not know, but certainly not long. This, as far as I can recollect, is
about twenty-five years since. The person who showed me the body, and
who was either one of the Marstons or a manager of the business, told me
he had seen the coffins opened, and that the features were then perfect.
When exhibited to me the nose and lips were gone, as were also two front
teeth, which had been torn from the mouth surreptitiously and taken
away. I understood that it was known who had them, and that they would
be restored. The shroud was discoloured, I presume from natural causes,
being of a dirty yellow colour, as though it had been drawn through a
clay pit. The texture and strength of the cloth remained unaffected.
Baskerville entertained peculiar opinions on religious subjects. There
was a rumour of some efforts having been made to deposit his remains in
one of the church burial grounds, but they were not successful. A year
or two ago, while in Birmingham, a snuff-box was shown me, on the lid of
which a portrait of Baskerville was painted, which fully agreed with a
description of his person given me many years previously by one who had
known him. This portrait had not, from its appearance, been painted very
long. From its being there I infer that there is in existence at least
one original portrait of this eminent printer.</p>

<h4><span><i>Inscription on a Claymore</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 59.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Is your correspondent
"T. M. W., Liverpool," who inquires the translation of an "inscription
on a claymore," certain that his quotation is correct? To me it appears
that it should run thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>[X] GOTT BEWAR DE</p>
      <p>[X] <i>G</i>ERECHTE SCHOTTEN.</p>
</div>

<p>or, "God preserve the righteous (or just) Scots;" referring, no doubt,
to the undertaking in which they were then engaged.</p>

<p>I believe that formerly, and probably at the present time, many of the
finest sword blades were made abroad, and sent to England to be mounted,
or even entirely finished on the Continent. I have in my possession a
heavy trooper's sword, bearing the name of a celebrated German maker,
although the ornaments and devices are unquestionably English. Another
way of accounting for the inscription is, that it belonged to some of
those foreign adventurers who are known to have joined Charles Edward.</p>

<p>&mdash;In Hunter's <i>History of

Sheffield, in which are the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Richard Burton of Tutbury, Staffordshire, died May 9th, 8 Henry
   V. Married Maud, sister of Robert Gibson of Tutbury; and had a
   son, Sir William Burton of Falde and Tutbury, Knight; slain at
   Towtonfield, 1461, from whom descended the Burtons of Lindley."</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Thomas Burton of Fanshawgate, who died in 1643, left three sons;
   Michael, Thomas, and Francis. Michael was of Mosborough, and had
   a numerous issue; the names of his children appear on his
   monumental brass in the chancel of the church at Eckington.
   Thomas, the second son, was of London and Putney, married, and
   had issue. Francis, the youngest, was lord of the Manor of
   Dronfield, and served the office of High Sheriff of Derby in
   1669. Was buried at Dronfield in 1687."</p>

<h4><span><i>Notation by Coalwhippers</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 21.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The notation used by
coalwhippers, &amp;c., mentioned by I. J. C., is, after all, I expect, but a
part of a system which was probably the origin of the Roman notation.
The first four strokes or units were cut diagonally by the fifth, and
taking the first and last of these strokes we readily obtain V, or the
Roman five; but as the natural systems of arithmetic are decimal, from
the number of fingers, it is most probable that the <i>tens</i> were thus
marked off, or by a stroke drawn across the last unit thus X, whence we
obtain the Roman ten: these tens were repeated up to a hundred, or the
second class of tens, which were probably connected by two parallel
lines top and bottom [C];, which would be the sign of the second
class of tens, or hundreds; this became afterwards rounded into C: the
third class of tens, or thousands, was represented by four strokes M,
and these symbols served by abbreviation for some intermediate numbers;
thus X divided became V, or 5, the half of 10; then L, half of [C],
 represented 50, half of 100; and M becoming rounded thus (M); was frequently expressed in this manner CI&#390;; and this became
abbreviated into D, 500, half of CI&#390; or 1000: and thus, by variously
combining these six symbols (though all derived from the one straight
stroke), numbers to a very high amount could be expressed.</p>

<h4><span><i>Statue of Charles II.</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 40.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The following passage is
from Hughson's <i>History of London</i>, vol. ii. p. 521.:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Among the adherents and sufferers in the cause of Charles II.
   was Sir Robert Viner, alderman of London. After the Restoration
   the worthy alderman, willing to show his loyalty and prudence,
   raised in this place [<i>i. e.</i> the Stock's Market] the statue
   above mentioned. The figure had been carved originally for John
   Sobieski, king of Poland, but by some accident was left upon the
   workman's hands. Finding the work ready carved to his hands, Sir
   Robert thought that, with some alteration, what was intended for
   a king of Poland might suit the monarch of Great Britain; he
   therefore converted the Polander into an Englishman, and the Turk
   underneath his horse into Oliver Cromwell; the turban on the last
   figure being an undeniable proof of the truth attached to the
   story. The compliment was so ridiculous and absurd, that no one
   who beheld it could avoid reflecting on the taste of those who
   had set it up; but as its history developed the farce improved,
   and what was before esteemed contemptible, proved in the end
   entertaining. The poor mutilated figure stood neglected some
   years since among the rubbish in the purlieus of Guildhall; and
   in 1779, it was bestowed by the common council on Robert Viner,
   Esq., who removed it to grace his country seat."</p>

<p>The earliest engraving of "the King at the Stock's Market" may be seen
in Thomas Delaune's <i>Present State of London</i>, 12mo. 1681.</p>

<h4><span><i>Serius, where situated?</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 494.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The Serius, now Serio,
rises in the chain of mountains in the south of the Valteline, between
the lakes Como and Ixo: it flows through a valley called the Val Seria,
passes near Bergamo and Cremona, and falls into the Adda a little before
that river joins the Po.</p>

<h4><span><i>Corpse passing makes a Right of Way</i></span>
 <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 477. 507. 519.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Some time ago, I buried in our churchyard a person from an
adjoining parish; but, instead of taking a pathway which led directly
from the house of the deceased to the church, they kept to the
high-road,&mdash;so going
<a id="going125"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[125]</span>
four miles instead of one. When I asked
the reason, I was told that the pathway was not a <i>lich-road</i>, and
therefore it was not lawful to bring a corpse along it.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Petworth Register</i></span>
 <span>(Vol. iii., p. 510.; Vol. iv., p. 27.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your
correspondents L<span class="smcap lowercase">LEWELLYN</span> and J. S. B. do not appear to be acquainted
with Heylyn's quotations from the book thus designated. In one place (p.
63., folio; vol. i. p. 132., 8vo.) he refers to it for a statement&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "That many at this time [<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1548] affirmed the most blessed
   Sacrament of the altar to be of little regard," &amp;c.</p>

<p>And in another place (p. 65., folio; vol. i. p. 136., 8vo.), he gives an
extract relating to Day, Bishop of Chichester:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Sed Ricardus Cicestrensis, (ut ipse mihi dixit) non
   subscripsit."</p>

<p>Hence the <i>Register</i> would seem to have been a sort of chronicle, kept
by the rector of Petworth; and it does not appear whether it was or was
not in the same volume with the register of births, marriages, and
deaths. In the latter case, it may possibly be still in the Petworth
parish chest; for the returns to which your correspondents refer, would
probably not have mentioned any other registers than those of which the
law takes cognizance. On the other hand, if the chronicle was attached
to the register of births, &amp;c., it may have shared the too common fate
of early registers; for, when an order of 1597 directed the clergy to
transcribe on parchment the entries made in the proper registers since
the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, they seem to have generally
interpreted it as a permission to make away with the older registers,
although there <i>are</i> cases in which the proper books are still
preserved. (I am myself acquainted with two in this neighbourhood; and
J. S. B., if I am right in identifying him with the author of the very
curious and valuable <i>History of Parish Registers</i>, can no doubt mention
many others.) But how did Heylyn, who collected most of his materials
about 1638, get hold of the book?</p>

<p><i>Holland's "Monumenta Sepulchralia Ecclesiæ S. Pauli"</i> (Vol. ii., p.
265.; Vol. iii., p. 427.; Vol. iv., p. 62.).&mdash;Sir Egerton Brydges, in
his <i>Censura Literaria</i>, vol. i. p. 305., attributes this work to
<i>Henry</i> Holland. In his notice of <i>Heroologia Anglica</i>, he says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The author was Henry Holland, son of Philemon Holland, a
   physician and schoolmaster at Coventry, and the well-known
   translator of Camden, &amp;c. Henry was born at Coventry, and
   travelled with John, Lord Harrington, into the Palatinate in
   1613, and collected and wrote (besides the <i>Heroologia</i>)
   <i>Monumenta Sepulchralia Ecclesiæ S. Pauli, Lond.</i>, 4to.; and
   engraved and published <i>A Book of Kings, being a true and lively
   effigies of all our English Kings from the Conquest till this
   present</i>, &amp;c., 1618. He was not educated either in Oxford or
   Cambridge; having been a member of the society of Stationers in
   London. I think it is most probable that he was brother to
   Abraham Holland, who subscribes his name as 'Abr. Holland alumnus
   S. S. Trin. Coll. Cantabr.' to some copies of Latin verses on the
   death of John, second Lord Harrington, of Exton, in the
   <i>Heroologia</i>; which Abraham was the author of a poem called
   <i>Naumachia, or Holland's Sea-Fight</i>, Lond. 1622, and died Feb.
   18, 1625, when his <i>Posthuma</i> were edited by 'his brother H.
   Holland.' At this time, however, there were other writers of the
   name of Hen. Holland.&mdash;(See Wood's <i>Athenæ</i>, i. 499.)"</p>

<h4><span><i>Mistake as to an Eclipse</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 58.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;From your
correspondent's mention of it, I should have supposed Casaubon meant
that the astronomers had been mistaken in the <i>calculation</i> of an
eclipse. But the matter is of another kind. In the <i>lunar</i> eclipse of
April 3, 1605, two <i>observers</i>, Wendelinus and Lansberg, in different
longitudes, made the eclipse end at times far more different than their
difference of longitudes would explain. The ending of a lunar eclipse,
observed with the unassisted eye, is a very indefinite phenomenon.</p>

<p>The allusion to this, made by Meric Casaubon, is only what the French
call a <i>plat de son métier</i>. He was an upholder of the ancients in
philosophy, and his bias would be to depreciate modern successes, and
magnify modern failures. When he talks of the astronomer being "deceived
in the hour," he probably uses the word <i>hour</i> for <i>time</i>, as done in
French and old English.</p>

<p>When Mr. Murray commenced that admirable series of <i>Guides</i> which form
the indispensable companion of those restless spirits who delight with
each recurring summer&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
 <p> "To waft their <i>size to</i> Indus or the Pole,"</p>
</div>

<p>he first sent his Schoolmaster abroad; with what success those who have
examined, used, and trusted to his <i>Continental Handbooks</i> best can
tell. Whether Mr. Murray is now actuated by a spirit of patriotism, or
of moral responsibility under the remembrance that "charity begins at
home," we neither know nor care; since our "home-staying" friends, as
well as all who visit us, will benefit by the new direction which his
energy has taken. Among the first fruits of this we have Murray's
<i>Handbook for Modern London</i>, which did not need the name of our valued
contributor M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. P<span class="smcap lowercase">ETER</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">UNNINGHAM</span> at the foot of its preliminary
advertisement to show the mint in which it was coined; for it is in
every page marked with the same characteristics, the same laborious
research&mdash;the same scrupulous exactness&mdash;the same clear and distinct
arrangements, which won such deserved praise for that gentleman's
<i>Handbook for London, Past and Present</i>. Any visitor to London, be he
mere sight-seer or be he artist, architect, statist, &amp;c., will find in
this neatly printed volume the most satisfactory replies to his
inquiries.</p>

<p><i>The Handbook to the Antiquities in the British Museum, being a
Description of the Remains of Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian and Etruscan
Art, preserved there</i>, by W. S. W. Vaux, <i>Assistant in the Department of
Antiquities</i>, has been compiled for the purpose of laying before the
public the contents of one department of the British Museum&mdash;that of
antiquities&mdash;in a compendious and popular form. The attempt has been
most successful. Mr. Vaux has not only the advantage of official
position, but of great practical knowledge of the subject, and abundant
scholarship to do it justice; and the consequence is, that his <i>Handbook
to the Antiquities in the British Museum</i> will be found not only most
useful for the special object for which it has been written, but a
valuable introduction to the study of Early Art.</p>

<p>There are probably no objects in the Great Exhibition which have
attracted more general attention than the Stuffed Animals exhibited by
Herrmann Ploucquet, of Stuttgart. Prince and peasant, old and young, the
pale-faced student deep in Goethe and Kaulbach, and the hard-handed
agriculturist who picked up his knowledge of nature and natural history
while plying his daily task,&mdash;have all gazed with delight on the
productions of this accomplished artist. That many of these admirers
will be grateful to Mr. Bogue for having had daguerreotypes of some of
the principal of these masterpieces taken by M. Claudet, and engravings
made from them on wood as faithfully as possible, we cannot doubt: and
to all such we heartily recommend <i>The Comical Creatures from
Wurtemburg; including the Story of Reynard the Fox, with Twenty
Illustrations</i>. The letter-press by which the plates are accompanied is
written in a right Reynardine spirit; and whether as a memorial of the
Exhibition&mdash;of the peculiar talent of the artist&mdash;or as a gift book for
children&mdash;this pretty volume deserves to be widely circulated.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOKS</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECEIVED</span>.&mdash;Neander's <i>General History of the Christian Religion
and Church</i>, vol. iv., is the new volume of Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i>;
and it speaks very emphatically for the demand for cheap editions of
works of learning and research that it can answer Mr. Bohn's purpose to
issue a translation of such a book as this by the great ecclesiastical
historian of Germany in its present form.</p>

<p><i>The Stone Mason of Saint Pont, a Village Tale from the French of De
Lamartine</i>, a new volume of Bohn's cheap series, is a tale well
calculated to stir the sympathy of the reader, and to waken in him
thoughts too deep for tears. It must prove one of the most popular among
the works of imagination included in the series; as its companion
volume, <i>Monk's Contemporaries, Biographic Studies of the English
Revolution, by M. Guizot</i>, must take a high place among the historical
works. M. Guizot describes his Sketches as "constituting, together with
Monk, a sort of gallery of portraits, in which persons of the most
different character appear in juxtaposition;" and a most interesting
study they make&mdash;not the less, perhaps, because, as the author candidly
avows, "in spite of the great diversity of manners, contemporary
comparisons and applications will present themselves at every step,
however careful we may be not to seek them."</p>

has the highest possible value."&mdash;<i>Architectural Quarterly Review.</i></p>

His 'Architectural Parallels' are worthy of the best days of art, and
show care and knowledge of no common kind. All his lesser works have
been marked in their degree by the same careful and honest spirit. His
attempt to discriminate our architecture into periods and assign to it a
new nomenclature, is therefore entitled to considerable
respect."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

such congregations as I have had to preach to; at any rate, in my
opinion. And, as a further proof of their adaptation to the people's
wants (and indeed the best proof that could be given), I have been
requested by some of my parishioners to lend them sermons, which were
almost <i>verbatim et literatim</i> transcripts of yours. That you may judge
of the extent to which I have been indebted to you, I may mention that
out of about seventy sermons which I preached at W&mdash;, five or six were

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
